        <div class="subheading mb-5">Market @ Glen Mor Student Lead</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second-year student majoring in psychology at University of California, Riverside. I am mostly an extroverted person who is passionate and hard-working. I take everything I do seriously and I always try to be prepared for whatever I know is coming my way. I am usually the type of person to plan things out accordingly so that I know what needs to be done. In addition, I am also able to communicate with other team members to see if they need any help or if I am having trouble with something myself. I previously worked as a tutor for elementary school students at an after-school program. When I worked there, I would tutor the students who were struggling with English and I would also help them with their homework. I also supervised the students during their break and when the teacher was away. <br><br>

        The type of leadership style I have is one that focuses on helping other people and offering support to people when needed. I like observing the situation first and then seeing what I can do to meet people’s needs. When I work and I see there there are a lot of people already doing the work that I am supposed to be doing, I normally assess the situation to see what I can do to help and to see if anything needs to be restocked or cleaned. This means that I try to act in places that I feel that I am needed and can do my best to support my coworkers. An example is that to support the people at my workplace, there are times when I will act as a runner, a person that helps restock hot and cold foods, when we don’t have one and there is a rush, I will also restock the drinks if I notice that we don’t have any or put myself in dishroom when I see that they need help and I am done with what I need to do. <br><br>

        A time when I showed leadership was when I took the initiative to show new people what they should do for the shifts they were assigned. Since I generally knew how most things worked, I was able to guide people and tell them what they needed to do and where they could find the things they needed. An example of this was when I showed someone what they should do for their custodial shift. I guided them around the market and told them what they needed to do, such as sanitize and mop the bathrooms every hour and marking it on the sheet, going around and checking the trashbins on the outside and inside of the market, and also sweeping and mopping the floor in the lobby area. A strength I have is that I like connecting with the people around me and I am also observant, I can notice what needs to be done and tell my coworkers in a friendly manner what they can do to help if they are free. A weakness that I have is that I focus too much on the details and try to make things perfects. So I tend to spend more time on one simple task more than another task that needs to be done. <br><br>
